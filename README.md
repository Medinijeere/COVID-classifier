1. Affected, 2. Non COVID, in this 2 classes if the xray is non affected the process terminates and if affected it will detect whether COVID, or TB.
2. The ML method employed here is CNN model to perform image classifictaion in GRAYSCALE.
3. The code explains the importance and efficiency of feature extraction's importance and a valuable guide to practice ML porjects.
4. The dataset used is from a open source plateform on kaggel.
